<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Survive the Elements is a game made in canvas for HTML. In the game, the player will
use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control an airplane in an attempt to dodge weather 
elements such as rain, hail, and tornadoes. There is no win condition for the game, only
a lose condition. When the player is hit by the enemy objects, the game will end. However,
there will be a timer that begins when the game begins, and will stop once the player 
loses the game. The goal of the game is to last as long as possible in the treacherous
weather. You can find the project here: <a href="">Survive The Elements</a> </p>

<h2>Design and Technical Changes</h2>
<p>There were not many design changes made after creating the design document. 
However, some technical changes were made. Our initial document depicted many more
enemy elements to the game, as well as power-ups for the player. For the sake of time,
those elements of the game had to be dropped.</p>
